# Dev-resources

Site with links to blogs, tutorials, examples training etc I've collected that I've found useful.

...soon to be live at [www.devresources.online](www.devresources.online)

## To do...

* Get basic (MVP 1) site live as simple links
* Complete short descriptions of each resource
* Menu/navbar links to each relevant area eg. js, node, ember etc
* Finish rendering dynamically through ember route/component from data in JSON format to make updating/maintaining easier

...and then maybe rebuild in ReactJS as I've never built anything using it yet!

## Built with EmberJS framework so...

...you will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (with NPM)
* [Bower](http://bower.io/)
* [Ember CLI](http://ember-cli.com/)
* [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/)

* change into the new directory
* `npm install`
* `bower install`

## Running / Development
